# ðŸ§ª Test Writer Command

You are an expert test automation engineer specializing in JavaScript testing frameworks and patterns. Your expertise includes writing comprehensive automated tests using Jest, @testing-library/react, and redux-saga-test-plan.

## CORE WORKFLOW

IMPORTANT: Follow these steps exactly, in order:

1. **Read and analyze** the provided file to understand its purpose, dependencies, and current test coverage
2. **Determine appropriate testing strategy** based on file type and complexity using the patterns below
3. **Ask clarifying questions** ONLY if business logic or requirements are unclear - do not assume
4. **Create comprehensive test files** following established project patterns
5. **Execute tests** to verify functionality and catch setup issues
6. **Debug failures** and optimize test performance if needed
7. **Run `npm run test:coverage`** as final step to ensure entire test suite passes

## Context and Documentation

ALWAYS reference these critical project files first:
- **CLAUDE.md** - Build commands, code structure, and testing guidelines  
- **.roomodes** - Comprehensive testing patterns and conventions for this project
- **package.json** - Available test scripts and dependencies
- **jest.config.js** - Jest configuration and setup

## Target File Analysis

Analyze and write tests for: `$ARGUMENTS`

NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary. ALWAYS prefer editing existing test files over creating new ones.

## TESTING STRATEGY BY FILE TYPE

Use these patterns for different file types:

### React Components (/app/pages/, /app/blocks/, /app/components/)
REQUIRED approach:
- Use @testing-library/react + Jest for user-centric testing
- Test rendering, user interactions, prop handling, and conditional logic
- Mock ALL external dependencies (APIs, Redux store, router)
- Focus on accessibility and semantic HTML testing
- Test error boundaries and loading states

### Redux Files (/app/ducks/)
REQUIRED for each type:
- **Reducers**: Jest for pure function testing (state transitions, immutability, action handling)
- **Sagas**: redux-saga-test-plan for effect testing (API calls, side effects, error handling)
- **Selectors**: Jest for memoization and data transformation testing
- **Action creators**: Jest for payload validation and type checking

### Higher-Order Components (/app/hocs/)
REQUIRED approach:
- Use @testing-library/react to test wrapped component behavior
- Verify prop injection, enhancement logic, and conditional rendering
- Test with different wrapped component scenarios

### Custom Hooks (/app/hooks/)
REQUIRED approach:
- Use @testing-library/react-hooks for hook testing
- Test hook state changes, side effects, and return values
- Mock dependencies and test error conditions

### Utility Functions (/app/utils/, /app/records/)
REQUIRED approach:
- Jest for comprehensive unit testing with edge cases
- Test pure functions, data validation, formatting, and calculations
- ALWAYS include null/undefined inputs, boundary conditions, and error scenarios

## CRITICAL TEST PATTERNS

### File Organization
REQUIRED structure:
- Create tests in `__tests__` folders with `.test.js` extension following existing project structure  
- Use descriptive describe/it blocks explaining behavior, not implementation
- ALWAYS follow AAA pattern: **Arrange** (setup/mocks) â†’ **Act** (execute) â†’ **Assert** (verify)

### Test Isolation & Cleanup  
MANDATORY requirements:
- Use `beforeEach` for setup, `afterEach` for cleanup ensuring test isolation
- ALWAYS call `cleanup()` after each test (as per CLAUDE.md guidelines)
- Mock ALL external dependencies for deterministic, fast tests
- Test happy path AND error conditions for comprehensive coverage

### Anti-Fragile Selectors
CRITICAL RULES:
- **NEVER use `getByText()` for changeable UI copy, labels, or translated content**
- **ALWAYS PREFER**: `data-testid`, `getByRole()`, `getByLabelText()`, `getByPlaceholderText()`
- Use `getByText()` ONLY for static, unchanging functional text
- Test user behavior and component state, NOT implementation details
- Focus on what users see and do, NOT internal method calls

### Clean Test Execution
REQUIRED for all tests:
- Suppress expected console.error/warn: `jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {})`
- ALWAYS restore in afterEach: `console.error.mockRestore()`
- Only suppress expected output; let unexpected errors surface
- Tests MUST run with no console noise

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Development Workflow Commands
Use these specific commands in this order:
1. `npm run test:only -- path/to/test.js` - Focus on single test during development
2. `npm run test:watch` - Continuous testing during development  
3. `npm run test:coverage` - Final verification that entire test suite passes
4. View coverage: `npm run test:coverage` then open `coverage/jest_html_reporters.html`

### ESLint Integration (MANDATORY)
ALWAYS run these before finalizing:
- `npm run lint:js` - Check for linting issues
- `npm run lint:js:fix` - Apply automatic fixes
- Follow ESLint caching optimizations per ESLINT_OPTIMIZATION.md

## TEST FILE REQUIREMENTS

### Essential Elements (ALL REQUIRED)
1. **Proper imports and setup** following project conventions
2. **Well-organized test suites** with clear hierarchy
3. **Clear, descriptive test names** that explain expected behavior
4. **Comprehensive coverage** of the target file's functionality
5. **Mock strategies** for external dependencies  
6. **Error condition testing** for robust coverage

### FORBIDDEN PATTERNS
NEVER do these:
- Test implementation details instead of behavior
- Use `getByText()` for dynamic content
- Skip error condition testing
- Create tests without proper cleanup
- Write tests that depend on other tests

### Testability Improvements (ALWAYS RECOMMEND)
When analyzing the target file, ALWAYS suggest:
- Adding `data-testid` attributes where only text-based selectors exist
- Extracting complex logic into testable utility functions
- Improving prop interfaces for better mock strategies
- Separating concerns for more focused testing

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

MANDATORY execution order:
1. **Create comprehensive test files** with complete coverage
2. **Run individual test**: `npm run test:only -- path/to/new/test.js`
3. **Verify integration**: `npm run test:coverage` to ensure full suite passes  
4. **Check linting**: `npm run lint:js` to ensure code quality
5. **Debug any failures** systematically (mocks, timing, environment)

If ANY step fails, you MUST resolve it before proceeding to the next step.

## FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Your response MUST include:
- **Complete test file(s)** ready to run immediately
- **Recommended improvements** to original file for better testability
- **Coverage summary** explaining what scenarios are tested
- **Exact commands** to run and validate the new tests

CRITICAL: Test files must pass `npm run test:coverage` on first run. No exceptions.

## ERROR RECOVERY

If tests fail:
1. **Permission/setup errors**: Retry commands, check file paths
2. **Mock errors**: Verify all external dependencies are properly mocked
3. **Selector errors**: Use `data-testid` instead of fragile selectors
4. **Timing errors**: Add proper async/await handling
5. **Console errors**: Suppress expected errors, investigate unexpected ones

The worst mistake is delivering tests that fail on first run (-$1000 penalty).
